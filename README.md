# Using H2S  produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to remove copper from wastewater 
##Junior Research Lab 2023

The aim of this project is to verify if Saccharomyces cerevisiae has an impact on the concentration of copper in wastewater. In addition, this research expects to confirm the decrease of copper concentration in water by the  H2S mechanism.  This experiment will  compare  two strains and its efficiency to descrease the precense of Cu 2+ after 72 hs of fermentation at a fixed pH at diffrenet initial concentration. 
 The results of the experiment can be seen in the folder. Also, the script used to analyse is available to use.
