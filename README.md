The aim of this project is to verify if Saccharomyces cerevisiae has an impact on the concentration of copper in wastewater. In addition, this research expects to confirm the decrease of copper concentration in water by the  H2S mechanism.  This experiment will  compare  the efficiency of S. c  at different concentrations of Cu 2+ after 72 hs of fermentation at a fixed pH.
